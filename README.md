# Why I Built This Lab

 * I wanted to go beyond just studying, I wanted to put a face on these commands and outputs, start building something that mimicked  a ral-world network.
 * My goal was to learn how to segment traffic, simulate real devies, and understand how everything talks to each other in a secure way (still has way more to learn).
 * Last but not least something repliucable in life, something that I could build up, therefore take my learning beyond academic knowledge but also practical.
